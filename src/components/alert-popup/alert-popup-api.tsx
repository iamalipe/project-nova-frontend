 * This acts as a bridge. React components cannot easily expose imperative functions to non-React
 * code without hooks. By storing the function reference in a plain JavaScript object, we can
 * import and trigger the alert dialog from anywhere in our codebase—including inside hooks,
 * helper utilities, network interceptors, or standard event handlers.
 *
 * The AlertPopupProvider (rendered at the app root) overrides `alertPopupApi.show` with its
 * internal stateful `showAlertResolver` function upon mounting.
